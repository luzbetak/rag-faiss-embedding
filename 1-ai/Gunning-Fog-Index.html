<h1>Gunning Fog Index</h1>
The Gunning Fog Index is a readability test that estimates the years of formal education needed to understand a text on the first reading. It takes into account the number of words, the number of complex words (words with three or more syllables), and the number of sentences in a text.

    <h1>Gunning Fog Index Explanation</h1>

    <p>The Gunning Fog Index is a readability test that estimates the years of formal education needed to understand a text on the first reading. The implementation calculates the Gunning Fog Index using the following steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Words:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The code counts all words in the text using regular expressions.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sentences:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Sentences are counted by splitting the text at sentence-ending punctuation marks, such as period (.), exclamation mark (!), and question mark (?).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Complex Words:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A complex word is defined as one with three or more syllables.</li>
                <li>The <code>syllable_count</code> function estimates the number of syllables in a word by analyzing vowel patterns.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gunning Fog Index Calculation:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The formula used for the Gunning Fog Index is:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Average sentence length = number of words / number of sentences.</li>
                        <li>Percentage of complex words = (number of complex words / number of words) * 100.</li>
                        <li>The Gunning Fog Index is calculated as:
                            <code>0.4 * (average sentence length + percentage of complex words)</code>.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Gunning Fog Index of 7-8 is considered optimal for general readership.</li>
        <li>A higher score suggests that the text is more difficult to read, requiring higher levels of education.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This implementation provides a way to rank texts based on readability using the Gunning Fog Index, which is useful in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as document analysis, content creation, and education.</p>
